-> FOLDER 'python codes' contains:
	-> codes for each case to train the network using tensorflow   ->   run_training*.py
	-> codes for each case to estimate the flow using a trained model   ->   run_predictions*.py
	-> codes to introduce noise in the estimation process over a trained model   ->   run_predicions*noise.py
	-> code 'matfileconverter.py' to conver the estimation output (.npy) into matlab files (.mat)
   Set the variable 'root_folder' in the last lines of the codes accordingly with the location of the folders 'models' and/or 'tfrecords'.
   In codes for estimation, select the architecture and the checkpoint according to the files in folder 'models'.

-> FOLDER 'channel coordinates' contains:
	-> files 'coordX.npy', 'coordY.npy' an 'coordZ.npy'. These files may be useful to reconstruct the geometry of the channel.
